Synopsys DWC HDMI 1.4 Tx Controller API Release Notes


Overview
The API software is an abstraction layer of the dwc_hdmi14_tx controller that configures the
hardware to behave according to the application user's requisites. 
The API combines many of the functionalities of the hardware into simple 
interface-functions, and thus has a layered architecture itself to perform 
these complex tasks.
API configures video, audio and packets, as well as HDCP to function in
compliance with the HDMI and HDCP protocols. 



Version 2.00
17th December 2010

Purpose
Major release of the full api level in C.


Fixed Defects
- Fix bug in video sampler.
- Fix register addresses in GPA interface. Reflecting a bug fix in controller databook.
- Fix GPA interface configuration issues.
- Fix packets_AudioInfoFrame configuration addressing issue.


New Features and Enhancements
- Add sampling frequency factor to audio which permits configuration of various factors for the audio interfaces supported
- Remove YCC422 mapping (only map 1 is supported)
- Remove several writes to obselete controller registers of versions prior to 1.10.a
- Separate PHY from core as a separate project
- PHY selection is done using defines in file phy.h, and add a PHY_THIRD_PARTY compilation option
- Add a timeout define in PHY (in number of cycles) before detecting PLL lock times out (needs < 30us)
- Add audio support to SPDIF when Fs factor is 1024, and remove for factor 128
- Change HPD detection to interrupts, add inversion of polarity of HPD interrupt upon change
- Port testbench and CLI to C
- Add edid read function to API with registering a callback (removing sleep), and modify edid reading state machine
- Enhance API internal state machine
- Improve overall code readibility
- update inline documentation
- Hdcp remove sleeps and increase attempts to access memory. HDCP engine will always allow for memory access within 4-8 clock cycles after interrupt, where clock is SFR clock
- Add compliance for complaince tests (hdcp and hdmi) automatic modes
- Remove access write ones and access write zeros functions



Version 1.02
05th November 2010

Purpose
Second release of the full api level.


Fixed Defects
- Change const static to static const
- Correct a minor bug (channel count returns the actual count -1)


New Features and Enhancements
- Add GPA interface and allow for different packet types to be carried on same 
	interfaces.
- Disable interrupts upon entring Configure function in API, and enable them just
	before exiting in api.c
- Remove const returns
- Reflect channel allocation in VALIDITY bit
- Remove HBR DDR support


Interoperability Testing
- This API has been tested with DWC_hdmi_tx controllers 1.10a, 1.20a and 1.30a IP on DWC_hdmi_tx Demo Platform
- This API is found compliant with HDMI 1.4a CTS Compliance tests Protocol and Electrical
- This API is found compliant with HDCP 1.4 Compliance tests
- This API has been tested with HDMI 1.3 Transmitter (TX) PHY 2.25Gbps in TSMC 65nm GP 2.5V
- This API has been tested with HDMI 1.3 Transmitter (TX) PHY 2.25Gbps in Chartered 65nm LP 2.5V
- This API has been tested with HDMI 1.4 Transmitter (3D TX) PHY 3.4 Gbps in TSMC 40nm LP 2.5V


Known issues and limitations
- The API does not detect which PHY is attached to it and what protocol it uses. 
	This should be selected by the implementor - in the phy/phy.h
- Only one instantiation of the API is so far permitted.
- EDID reading is configured for 25MHz SFR frequency.
- EDID parsing of 3D strucutres is not implemented
